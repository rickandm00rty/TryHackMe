First I scanned for ports and protocols. 
Then we looked at all terminal commands, nothing interesting there
We found a .dic file in the /robots.txt directory and a "user-agent" field as well as a "key-1-of-3.txt" file

Key 2 is most likely located at the /wp-login.php location, which might require a brute force attack using Burp, Hydra, and the .dic file found previously.
